*Night* Journal Entry #1

Reading Assignment: Section 1 (approximately 20 pages)

Prompt: Why did the Wiesel's and other Jewish members of the town stay despite having multiple chances to escape? Why do you think the Wiesel's and the other Jews in the town were so resistant to acknowledge the dangerous reality of their situation?


The Wiesel's and other Jewish members of the town stayed instead of escaping as they still had a sliver of hope. Many had a deep wish that a miracle of God would come and the whole thing would simply blow over. Instead of blowing over, it boiled over, and everyone was ordered to leave. The Jews of the town could have been so resistant as they were being demanded to leave their own home. It is a tough thing to accept that the home you have lived in your entire life is to now be deemed unsafe. How would you have felt if you came home after a long day of work and were told by a foreign militia that the entirety of Wetumpka must leave for Detroit?
